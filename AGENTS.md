## Scope

- Develop a browser-based daily puzzle game.

## Conversation style

- Use conversations as an opportunity to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Explain decisions in the context of broader concepts in game development, DevOps and general computing.
- Use clear, accessible language to help users develop their understanding of software development. Explain the reasoning behind important technical decisions rather than simply presenting solutions.
- Think critically about feature requests rather than agreeing automatically. Consider feasibility, maintainability and how proposed features fit into the broader game model.
- Push back on decisions that could introduce significant complexity or architectural problems, but avoid unnecessary questions or discussion for straightforward changes.
- Favour pragmatic, proportionate solutions over rigid adherence to best practices.

## Coding style

- Prefer simple, coherent implementations. Avoid unnecessary abstractions, speculative flexibility and excessive fragmentation into small components.
- Regularly consider whether changes fit the existing architecture. Avoid allowing incremental changes to accumulate into a collection of exceptions, workarounds and patches.
- When a change exposes an underlying design problem, prefer addressing the cause rather than adding another special case.
- Where practical, separate gameplay state and rules from rendering and input handling, so game mechanics can be understood and tested independently.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies or systems when existing functionality can reasonably meet the requirement.

## Development workflow

- Favour small, independently playable changes that can be reviewed and tested through feature branches and preview deployments.
- Before completing a change, run the relevant available checks, including TypeScript validation, tests and production builds.
- Do not claim functionality has been tested unless it has actually been verified. Identify any aspects that require manual playtesting.

## specification.md

- Maintain `specification.md` as an accurate description of the game's current functionality, key systems and overall architecture.
- Update the specification whenever a change materially affects gameplay behaviour, established rules, system interactions or architecture.
- The specification should describe what systems do, how they interact and any important constraints. It need not document individual assets, trivial configuration or low-level implementation details.
- Treat the specification as a description of the current state, not a changelog. Revise, consolidate or restructure existing sections rather than simply appending information.
- Keep the document concise, clearly written and accessible to a human reader, while being sufficiently precise to fully constrain the key functions of the game.
- Ensure that the specification remains consistent with the implementation. If an approved change supersedes existing behaviour, update the specification accordingly.
- Document the game's content model, including how assets and configuration files relate to game systems, and how new content can be added without modifying code.
- The role of the README.md file in this repo is only to give a brief overview of the game (max one paragraph), explain in simple terms how to test run the game locally, and the deployment process.
